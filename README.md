# ContactList application in Console and WPF

A project for my .net education on EC. The project was first to build a contactlist-creator as a Console-application, and then create a WPF-application based out of the erlier base. 

The Console app needed to:
- Have a menu alternative that lists all contacts.
- Have a menu alternative that creates new contacts.
- Save all contacts to a json-file.
- Read all contacts from the json-file then application boots and when the list updates.
- Have mocking for all methods used.

The WPF app needed to:
- Have a page that lists all contacts.
- Have a page that creates new contacts.
- Have a page where you can edit and delete contacts.
- Save all contacts to a json-file.
- Read all contacts from the json-file then application boots and when the list updates.
- Use Dependency Injections.
- Use Class Library.


Further update that would make this app even better is inter alia to incorporate various validations like input-validations in both apps and validation-messages in WPF app when things goes succesfully or not.
